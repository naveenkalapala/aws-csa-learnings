AWS S3 - Simplified Explanation 

46. What is S3? 
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a cloud-based storage system where you can store and manage files (called objects) inside containers called buckets.  

Common Use Cases for S3 
- Backup & Storage‚Üí Store important files securely.  
- Disaster Recovery‚Üí Keep backups for emergencies.  
- Archive‚Üí Save old files that are rarely needed.  
- Hybrid Cloud Storage‚Üí Connect on-premises storage with S3.  
- Application & Media Hosting‚Üí Host apps, images, and videos.  
- Big Data & Analytics‚Üí Store large amounts of structured and unstructured data.  
- Software Delivery‚Üí Store and distribute files like software updates.

47. S3 Storage Classes (Cost vs. Access Frequency) 
    S3 offers different storage options depending on how often you need access:  

1. S3 Standard‚Üí Best for frequently accessed data (high performance, high cost).  
2. S3 Intelligent-Tiering‚Üí Automatically moves data to cheaper tiers if access is infrequent.  
3. S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)‚Üí Cheaper storage, but retrieval costs apply.  
4. S3 One Zone-IA‚Üí Even cheaper, but data is stored in only one region (higher risk).  
5. S3 Glacier‚Üí Low-cost, long-term storage for archives (retrieval takes hours).  
6. S3 Glacier Deep Archive‚Üí Cheapest option, but data takes 12-48 hours to retrieve.

48. S3 Buckets 
- A bucketis like a folder that stores objects (files).  
- Buckets must have globally unique namesacross AWS.  
- They are created within a specific AWS region.  

Bucket Naming Rules: 
‚úÖ 3-63 characters long  
‚úÖ Only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens  
‚ùå No uppercase letters or underscores  
‚ùå Cannot look like an IP address

49. S3 Objects (Files in S3) 
- Objects are files stored inside a bucket (e.g., images, videos, logs).  
- Each object has a unique key(filename) inside a bucket.  
- The maximum file size for an object is 5TB.  
- There are no traditional folders‚Äîjust keys with prefixes(like a directory structure).  

Example:  

s3://my-bucket/photos/image1.jpg  
s3://my-bucket/docs/report.pdf

50. S3 Bucket Policies & Access Control 
AWS provides two ways to control access:  

1. User-Based Policies (IAM Policies) 
   - Controls what specific users or rolescan do in AWS (e.g., read, write).  

2. Resource-Based Policies (S3 Bucket Policies & ACLs) 
   - Bucket Policy‚Üí Controls access at the bucket level (e.g., allow public access, enable cross-account access).  
   - ACL (Access Control List)‚Üí Grants permissions to specific users for objects or buckets.  

Examples: 
- Public Access‚Üí Use a Bucket Policyto allow public file access.  
- EC2 Access‚Üí Use an IAM Rolen to allow an EC2 instance to read/write from S3.  
- Cross-Account Access‚Üí Use a Bucket Policyto share data between AWS accounts.  

Security Tip:Enable Block Public Accessto prevent unauthorized data exposure.

51. S3 Static Website Hosting 
- You can host a static website(HTML, CSS, JS) directly on S3.  
- The website will be accessible via:  
  ```
  <bucket-name>.s3-website-<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com  
  ```

Example: 
- Uploaded an `index.html` file and enabled S3 Static Website Hosting.  

---

S3 Versioning (Protect Against Data Loss) 
- Enables multiple versions of an object.  
- Helps recover accidentally deleted or modified files.  
- When enabled, overwriting a file creates a new versioninstead of replacing it.  
- Best practice: Always enable versioningto avoid losing important data.  

Notes: 
- Files uploaded before versioningwas enabled get a version ID of "null".  
- Disabling versioningdoes NOT delete previous versions.

Hands-On Activities Completed 
‚úÖ Created a test S3 bucket and uploaded a file.  
‚úÖ Wrote a Bucket Policyto allow public access to an image.  
‚úÖ Created an S3 static websiteand hosted a basic `index.html`.  
‚úÖ Enabled S3 Versioningand tested file version management.
