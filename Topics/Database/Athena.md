What is Amazon Athena?

Amazon Athena is a **serverless**, **interactive query service** that enables you to run **SQL queries directly on data stored in Amazon S3** â€” without needing to set up or manage any infrastructure.

> Think of Athena as a way to query raw data (e.g., CSV, JSON, Parquet, logs) using standard SQL, with **zero server management**.

Key Concepts

- âœ… **Serverless** â€” No infrastructure or servers to manage  
- ðŸ’¸ **Pay-per-query** â€” Charged per TB of data scanned  
- ðŸ’¬ **Standard SQL support** â€” Powered by **Presto engine**  
- ðŸ“‚ Supports **structured, semi-structured, unstructured** data  
- ðŸ”„ **Federated Queries** â€” Query data across multiple sources (e.g., S3, RDS, Redshift)  
- ðŸ§  Integrates with **AWS Glue Data Catalog** for schema management

Supported File Formats

Athena supports querying data stored in:

* CSV, TSV
* JSON
* Parquet (columnar & compressed)
* ORC, Avro
* Apache Web Logs
* GZIP, Snappy compressed files

âš¡ Real-World Example: Querying Logs from S3

**Use Case**: Query CloudFront access logs stored in S3

**Steps:**

1. Define a table in Athena pointing to the log format in S3
2. Run a SQL query like:

```sql
SELECT uri, status, COUNT(*) 
FROM access_logs 
WHERE status = '404' 
GROUP BY uri;
```

Athena reads the data directly from S3 and returns results â€” no ETL or database needed.

Common Use Cases

| Use Case                           | Why Athena?                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Log analytics (CloudFront, S3)     | Query logs instantly               |
| Data lake querying (via Glue)      | Analyze S3 data in-place           |
| Ad-hoc querying of CSV/JSON        | Avoid ETL, just query directly     |
| Compliance/audit report generation | Fast filtering without DB overhead |
| BI dashboards                      | Integrates with QuickSight easily  |

Key Features

| Feature               | Description                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Serverless**        | No need to provision or manage compute |
| **SQL-based**         | Use familiar SQL for queries           |
| **Pay-per-query**     | Pay only for data scanned              |
| **Glue Data Catalog** | Central schema repository              |
| **Partitioning**      | Speeds up queries, reduces cost        |
| **Federated Queries** | Query across S3, RDS, DynamoDB, JDBC   |
| **Integration**       | Works with Redshift, QuickSight, etc.  |
| **Security**          | IAM-based access control, encryption   |

---

Cost Model

* **\$5 per TB scanned**
* Use **Parquet** or **ORC** + compression (e.g., GZIP, Snappy) to reduce scanned data
* Partition your datasets to avoid scanning entire buckets

Athena vs Other AWS Services

| Feature       | Athena                | Redshift                | AWS Glue                   |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Query Type    | Ad-hoc / Interactive  | OLAP / Data warehousing | ETL & transformation       |
| Setup         | Serverless            | Cluster-based           | Serverless                 |
| Data Location | S3 (raw files)        | Redshift tables         | S3, JDBC, multiple sources |
| Performance   | Good for small/medium | High for complex joins  | Not designed for queries   |
| Cost          | Per-TB scanned        | Based on cluster hours  | Job duration               |
