Supported Engines

ElastiCache supports two popular in-memory engines:

| Engine     | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Redis**  | Feature-rich, supports pub/sub, streams, persistence; used for low-latency |
| **Memcached** | Simple, multi-threaded, purely in-memory; used for high-throughput apps   |

Comparison:
- **Redis** is ideal for:
  - High-performance, low-latency data access  
  - Caching frequently accessed data  
- **Memcached** is ideal for:
  - Session data storage  
  - Lightweight caching with simple key-value access

Example Use Case Flow

```text
User Request
   ↓
Application (EC2)
   ↓
Check ElastiCache
   ↳ If HIT  → Return data instantly
   ↳ If MISS → Fetch from RDS → Store in Cache → Return to user
```
