# How to Register a Domain in Route 53

## Step 1: Sign in to AWS Management Console

* Go to [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)
* Log in with your AWS credentials.

---

## Step 2: Open Route 53 Console

* In the AWS Console, search for **Route 53** and open it.

---

## Step 3: Start Domain Registration

* In the Route 53 dashboard, click on **“Registered domains”** in the left navigation pane.
* Click on the **“Register Domain”** button.

---

## Step 4: Search for Your Domain Name

* Enter the domain name you want to register (e.g., `example.com`).
* Click **“Check”** to see if it is available.
* If the domain is available, proceed; if not, try a different name.

---

## Step 5: Add Contact Information

* Fill out the **Registrant Contact**, **Administrator Contact**, and **Technical Contact** details.
* This information is required for domain registration (public WHOIS info may be based on this).

---

## Step 6: Choose Privacy Protection

* AWS offers **privacy protection** (WHOIS privacy) for free for eligible domains.
* Enable it if you want to keep your personal info private.

---

## Step 7: Review and Purchase

* Review the domain name and contact information.
* Confirm the registration term (usually 1 year minimum).
* Check the cost of registration.
* Accept the terms and conditions.
* Click **“Complete Order”**.

---

## Step 8: Verification and Activation

* You may receive an email from the registrar asking you to verify your email address.
* Follow the verification steps to complete the registration.
* Domain registration typically takes a few minutes to a few hours.

---

## Step 9: Manage Your Domain

* Once registered, your domain will appear under **Registered domains**.
* Route 53 will automatically create a **public hosted zone** for your domain.
* You can now create DNS records (A, CNAME, MX, etc.) to route traffic to your resources.

---

# Notes:

* Domain registration fees vary by domain extension (TLD).
* You will be charged annually for domain renewal.
* You can also **transfer an existing domain** to Route 53 instead of registering a new one.
