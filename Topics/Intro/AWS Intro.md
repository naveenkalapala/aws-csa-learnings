Day 1: AWS Learning Notes

---

1. What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources, such as storage, servers, databases, and software, over the internet. It allows users to access these resources on-demand, eliminating the need to purchase and maintain their own physical infrastructure.

---

2. Types of Cloud Computing Services:

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): 
  - Rent IT infrastructure like servers, storage, networks, and operating systems.
  
- Platform as a Service (PaaS):
  - Provides developers with tools to build and host web applications.

- Software as a Service (SaaS):
  - Delivers software applications over the internet.

3. What is Virtualization in Cloud Computing?

Virtualization is a technology that enables logical isolation of physical resources (like CPU, RAM, and storage) over the cloud. It allows the creation of virtual instances of physical resources, enabling efficient resource utilization.

---

4. What is a Server Composed of?

- CPU (Central Processing Unit): Executes instructions for processing data.
- RAM (Random Access Memory): Temporary storage for active processes.
- Storage: Long-term storage for data.
- Database: A structured way to store data.
- Networking: Devices like routers, DNS servers, and switches that facilitate communication.

---

5. Five Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing:

- On-demand self-service: Resources can be provisioned as needed without human intervention.
- Broad network access: Services are available over the network and accessible through various devices.
- Resource pooling: Resources are pooled to serve multiple customers, with resources dynamically assigned and reassigned based on demand.
- Rapid elasticity: Resources can be rapidly scaled up or down based on demand.
- Measured Service: Resource usage is metered, and you pay only for what you use.
